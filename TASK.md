# R-Market design sprint

The competing teams in this hackathon are competing over who wins the account of a slumbering retail giant called R-Market. The client has provided you with direct access to the digital warehouse of the company, which is housed in the compressed folder your team has received.

Your job this weekend is to build or concept a digital service to wow the customer. You can use any and all data provided to you by the client, as well as the graphics and other assets they've provided.

The client is not very well versed in digital creations, so you've been given free hands on the implementation. They want you to impress them with your concepts.

## Evaluation criteria

The client doesn't really know what they're looking for yet, so use your imagination. We've attempted to provide you with a few different angles to approach the problem from.

The main criteria they're evaluating you on are:

```
- Idea and creativity
- Execution of the service/concept
- Cool implementations
- Use of data
- Presentation
```

## Remember to:

- **Have fun!** - Don't stress about things too much, we don't want you to overstress yourselves over the weekend.

- **Ask questions!** - We're happy to help you to the best of our ability. There are no dumb questions.

- **Try new things!** - This is a good chance to learn new things without actually starting too many fires!
